	<h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANNA MY BABY</h1>
	<hr>
	<p style="font-size: 20px; color: white";>

	Hi Anna,

	</p> 
	
	<p style="font-size: 20px; color: white";>

I created this space—had someone help me with it—because I wanted to show you just how much I value you. How much you mean to me. You are everything to me, and I want you to feel that every single day. Your feelings are so valid to me, and I’m always working on myself to be the best man I can be for you. I want you to feel heard, understood, and cherished.
<br><br>
I want to be the man you can turn to for anything, the one who makes you feel like you never have to walk on eggshells. I want to be the man who helps you feel free to express yourself, to be your true self, without fear. More than anything, I want you to feel like a child again in love—pure and safe, knowing that I will always handle whatever life brings.
<br><br>
I’m trusting in God to guide us, to solve our problems, and to bring us back together so that we can share our lives in the way we’ve always dreamed of—in a cornfield, where we live out our days together in peace and love.
<br><br>
But most of all, I want you to know that I care, more than anything. From infinity and beyond, I love you.

		<br>

							<h3 style="text-align: center;">HERE ARE 10 REASONS I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU</h3>	
		<li>your forehead</li>
		<li>your scent</li>
		<li>your texture</li>
		<li>your eyes</li>
		<li>your heart</li>
		<li>andddd your mind</li>

	<h4>Dear Anna, </h4>
	<p class="poem">
		<q>from where do i start my princess?,
			<br>by what standard am i to measure this love?,
			<br>how far of a distance would i travel to rediscover a love like this?,
			<br>im writing poems?,
			<br>on a webpage?,
			<br>my mumu button blatantly shining red?,
			<br>at my big age?,
			<br>this one i have never done before...
			<br>and so a girl from the east,
			<br>meets a boy from the south,
			<br>they connect,
			<br>they accept,
			<br>they reflect,
			<br>are they in love?,
			<br>dear God, direct.</q>
